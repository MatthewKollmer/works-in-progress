    "# How to Create Newspaper Clipping Images in Chronicling America, Programmatically\n",
    "\n",
    "I ran into a particularly challenging problem recently. It had to do with one of my forays with the Chronicling America API. I needed to create images of newspaper clippings from a subset of Chronicling America's digitized pages. I needed to produce tens of thousands of them for an interactive display. I'd already identified the clippings as OCR text (a different problem altogether). But I needed the _images_ of those clippings, not just the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm sure there are at least a few scholars and programmers who have dealt with this challenge before. Yet I couldn't find any pipelines or documentation explaining how they dealt with it. I'm also sure there will be other scholars who run into this challenge, too. In many cases, the OCR text is not the endpoint for researchers or educators. Sometimes, you need the image of the newspaper to drive home your points or to bring viewers closer to the original medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, I outline my pipeline for extracting these clipping images. I've added some steps for demonstrative purposes, but if you're just curious about the logic behind identifying and extracting images, feel free to scroll past the first parts of this walkthrough. By the end of it, you should have a better sense of how Chronicling America structures its image files and how to extract parts of them based on word or text locations on the page."

    "### 1) Libraries and Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this walkthrough, I'll show you how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- navigate the Chronicling America manifest files and XML files\n",
    "- scrape the necessary data for clipping images\n",
    "- cross-reference and extract a given text from the XML version of the newspaper pages\n",
    "- turn the XML version of the extracted text into the JPG image version\n",
    "\n",
    "For demonstrative purposes, I've provided a toy dataset composed of three newspaper pages. These pages all contain a noteworthy text: the Star-Spangled Banner. This toy dataset represents what a lot of initial data scraped from Chronicling America looks like. That is, it's just the newspaper title, the URL to the given newspaper page, and the date of the newspaper issue. You might end up with this kind of data after [scraping search results](https://github.com/MatthewKollmer/us_lynching_victims/blob/main/02_pull_search_results.ipynb), for example. These sorts of pulled data can be really useful for all sorts of downstream tasks. In this case, we'll be using this data as an entrypoint into the rest of the API.\n",

    "But first, you'll need to load the following Python libraries and the toy dataset, too, of course."

    "### 2) Chronicling America URL Structures and Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout these processes, we'll be manipulating Chronicling America's URL structures. These URL structures allow us to reach the parts of the API and the newspaper pages relevant to us. Chronicling America's URLs contain a lot of information. They also follow strict patterns. In our toy dataset, you'll notice the base_url column. It contains URLs to [specific newspaper pages](https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn83025588/1814-10-11/ed-1/?sp=4). These URLs are all structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "https<no link>://www<no link>.loc.gov/resource/{__sn_code__}/{__year__}-{__month__}-{__day__}/ed-{__edition_no__}/?sp={__page_no__}\n",
    "\n",
    "The __sn_code__ refers to Chronicling America's unique identifier for the given newspaper. The __year__, __month__, and __day__ refer to the given page's date of publication. The __edition_no__ refers to the iteration of digitization in Chronicling America. This is usually the first iteration, but sometimes, the same newspaper page is digitized and added to Chronicling America more than once–in which case the __edition_no__ might be two, three, etc. The __page_no__ refers to the page of the given newspaper issue. Most newspapers have between four and twelve pages, so the __page_no__ usually falls within that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when you have the base_url to specific pages in Chronicling America, you also have a lot of data about that page, and you can use this data to navigate other parts of the API. To get to the clipping image URLs, you'll need to repurpose this data a couple times over. In particular, you'll need to use it to point to Chronicling America's manifest pages, and then from the manifest pages, to the XML pages. This roundabout way of navigating the API is necessary because, unfortunately, the base_urls do not have all the necessary data to create the clipping images. More on that below. But first, a brief note on manifest pages and XML pages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Every newspaper issue in Chronicling America has a manifest. These manifests are basically lists of the files included with their given digitized newspaper issue. These manifests are provided as JSON files. They contain things like the URLs for the PDF version of the newspaper pages, the JPG version of the newspaper pages, the XML version, and so on. The manifests themselves have their own URLs, too. For example, here's the manifest for the first newspaper issue in our toy dataset: https://www.loc.gov/item/sn83025588/1814-10-11/ed-1/manifest.json.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you review that URL carefully, you'll notice it contains most of the same data as our base_url: __sn_code__, __year__, __month__, __day__, and __edition_no__. It doesn't have the __page_no__ because each page is included in the same manifest as its given newspaper issue. If you follow this manifest URL, you can review this JSON file with entries for each page. These entries list multiple file formats (XML, PDF, JPG, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to reach these manifests, so our first step is to build the manifest URLs using the data embedded in our base_url values. This is rather simple. It's just taking the __sn_code__, __year__, __month__, __day__, and __edition_no__ and putting them into the manifest URL pattern. Here's how I did it:"

    "Now we have the manifest URLs for each page in our toy dataset. From the manifest, we can identify the XML URLs. These URLs are important because of the data they contain as well. For example, if you follow this [manifest URL](https://www.loc.gov/item/sn83025588/1814-10-11/ed-1/manifest.json) and scroll down to the page entry of our [first base_url example](https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn83025588/1814-10-11/ed-1/?sp=4) (that's page four), you'll find the XML URL to the given page in the \"seeAlso\" entry: https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ndnp/nhd/batch_nhd_avalon_ver02/data/sn83025588/00517010820/1814101101/0168.xml.\n",
    "\n",
    "This XML URL contains the __sn_code__. It also contains the __year__, __month__, __day__, and __edition_no__, but they are in a different format (all compiled together without hyphens). It also contains data that's less self-explanatory. These data follow this strict pattern across XML URLs:\n",
    "\n",
    "https<no link>://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ndnp/{__submitter_code__}/batch_{__batch_filename__}/data/{__sn_code__}/{__reel_no__}/{__year_month_day_edition_no__}/{__unique_page_code__}.xml\n",
    "\n",
    "The __submitter_code__ is Chronicling America's abbreviated identifier for whatever institution submitted the given digitized page. You may be surprised to learn that Chronicling America and the Library of Congress are not the ones digitizing these newspapers. There is a grant system in place where regional institutions (libraries, universities, etc.), digitize their microfilm newspapers and submit them to be added to Chronicling America. The __submitter_code__ refers to whatever institution actually did the digitizing. Likewise, the __batch_filename__ refers to the file name used at the time of submission. If you're curious about these contributors and processes, you can [learn more here](https://www.loc.gov/collections/chronicling-america/index/contributor/?dl=page&fp=*&sb=index).\n",
    "\n",
    "I've already explained the __sn_code__, but relatedly, we now also have the __reel_no__. The __reel_no__ just refers to a subset of the newspaper pages in the given __sn_code__. Outside their appearance in these URL structures, I haven't found a use for the __reel_no__. They are just designated subsets, probably produced through some part of Chronicling America's digitization or uploading processes. Then there's __year_month_day_edition_no__––again, they've been explained already, but you'll notice they are smushed together in the case of the XML URLs. And finally, there's __unique_page_code__. These are four-digit numbers that refer to the specific page of the newspaper issue. You'd think they'd follow the pattern of the page (i.e. page 1 would be 0001, page 2 would be 0002, etc.), but unfortunately, they do not. I've yet to decode any pattern in the __unique_page_code__ values. They seem to be random digits for each page in a given newspaper issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when you extract these XML URLs from the manifests, you're also pulling all this data that can be used to point to the specific pages in the database. To extract the XML URLs, you'll need to do some scraping. There's many ways to approach this scraping. Below are steps I've repurposed for this walkthrough. They begin with my scrape_carefully() function. It's tuned to Chronicling America's rate limits (something you want to be careful about). Here it is:"

    "### 3) Example Text: the Star-Spangled Banner\n",
    "\n",
    "As I previously mentioned, this walkthrough is working with a toy dataset composed of pages that contain the Star-Spangled Banner. With all the data we've gathered through scraping the API, I'll now turn to identifying the Star-Spangled Banner on the pages and extracting its word coordinates. Since I'm working with a full-text example, this is a little more complicated than if you were just hoping to extract clippings around specific search terms. If that's the case, you may want to review [this Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/MatthewKollmer/us_lynching_victims/blob/main/10_exhibit_prep.ipynb). On step 9 of that notebook, I extract word coordinate data around a simple keyphrase rather than what I'm doing here, which is admittedly more complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, extracting a longer text is harder because of OCR errors. You're unlikely to find the full text of something like the Star-Spangled Banner in Chronicling America without at least one OCR error. To account for this, I'm adapting [methods from the Viral Texts Project](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dasmith/infect-bighum-2013.pdf)––namely, \"shingling\" the text into five-grams and checking those five-grams in a fuzzy match across the xml_content. Basically, what this entails is taking the full text of the Star-Spangled Banner and breaking it into a sequential list of five-grams (five-word strings). I'm also taking the text of the newspaper page and breaking it into indexed blocks. Then I'm cross-referencing the two. When sequences from the Star-Spangled Banner appear in the xml_content, I'm checking their order and indexing them. If there are roughly 10% of the five-grams from the Star-Spangled Banner in sequential order, I'm pulling those lines of text (plus any lines in between, and five lines beforehand, and five lines after, as a fuzzy spatial composition). The result is the xml_clipping value, which is just the subset of the xml_content that this fuzzy matching pipeline has identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: these lines in xml_content don't just contain the words. They also include the word coordinates. So, after this step, we've got xml_clippings which can point us to the specific coordinates where the text appears."

    "### 4) Building the Clipping Image URLs\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the final step. And it may be the most complicated. The goal here is to utilize all this data we've compiled to produce URLs that point to specific subsets of the newspaper images, like this: https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:ndnp:nhd:batch_nhd_avalon_ver02:data:sn83025588:00517010820:1814101101:0168/pct:5.90,19.30,17.10,38.50/!1000,1000/0/default.jpg\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, you'll notice this image URL follows a strict pattern that includes most of our previous data, plus some new stuff. Here's a quick breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "https<no link>://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:ndnp:{__submitter_code__}:batch_{__batch_filename__}:data:\n",
    "{__sn_code__}:{__reel_no__}:{__year_month_day_edition_no__}:{__unique_page_code__}/pct:{__horizontal_position__},{__vertical_position__},{__width_span__},{__height_span__}/{__size_ratio__}/{__rotation__}/default.jpg\n",
    "\n",
    "We've got most of our previously gathered data, like __submitter_code__, __batch_filename__, __sn_code__, etc. But we also have new variables that include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __horizontal_position__: the starting horizontal position as measured by a percentage of the full WIDTH of the page.\n",
    "- __vertical_position__: the starting vertical position as measured by a percentage of the full HEIGHT of the page.\n",
    "- __width_span__: the horizontal width of the image as measured by a percentage of the full WIDTH of the page.\n",
    "- __height_span__: the vertical height of the image as measured by a percentage of the full HEIGHT of the page.\n",
    "- __size_ratio__: the scale of the image.\n",
    "- __rotation__: the rotation in degrees of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "These data are all related to the pixels and orientations of the images. As a safe bet, you can leave the __size_ratio__ to !1000,1000. This ensures the size of the image will always scale to 1000 pixels. Too many or too few pixels will make the image blurry, but !1000,1000 is generally a safe bet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, in the vast majority of cases, you'll want to leave __rotation__ set to 0. This ensures the image will appear upright as it appears in Chronicling America. Any changes here will turn the image. So, for example, if __rotation__ is set to 180, the image will be upside down. If it's set to 90, it will be horizontal. Anything in between those standard right-angle measurements won't work. So, best leave __rotation__ set to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other new data can be manipulated within the ranges of the HEIGHT and WIDTH variables for the full page. For our purposes, we want them to match the word coordinates in our xml_clippings column. More specifically, we want the __horizontal_position__ to match the lowest HPOS value in the given xml_clipping. We want the __vertical_position__ to match the first VPOS value in the given xml_clipping. We want the __width_span__ to match the horizontal width of the xml_clipping. And we want the __height_span__ to match the vertical width of the xml_clipping. We also want these values to be represented as percentages of the full pixel HEIGHT and WIDTH of the digitized page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's some basic math for how I calculated these values. I'm not a statistician, so I haven't written these things out in fancy mathematical notations. Here's my pseudocode/rudimentary version instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __horizontal_position__: lowest HPOS value in xml_clipping / pg_width\n",
    "- __vertical_position__: VPOS of the first line in xml_clipping / pg_height\n",
    "- __width_span__: highest WIDTH value in xml_clipping / pg_width\n",
    "- __height_span__: VPOS of the last line in xml_clipping - VPOS of the first line / pg_height\n",
    "\n",
    "With these variables calculated, you've officially gathered everything you need to generate the images. Here's my code for implementing these final steps:"

    "It worked! Some caveats, though. Sometimes, the word coordinates are thrown off by anomalies in the XML. If you adapt this code and find that occasionally it doesn't render the right portion of the page, that may be why. There's also a challenge when newspaper articles are cut off by the bottom of the page and continue at the top of the page in the next column. My code doesn't account for that. So, sometimes, you might get clipping images that cover a broad swath of the page, making them harder to read. I haven't worked out how to deal with these instances yet. But I may follow up with another post as I polish this pipeline.\n",
